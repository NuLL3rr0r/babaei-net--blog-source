You can generate only one post while you are writing it using
    rake isolate[your-post]
and then
    rake integrate
to go back to normal.


By install Ruby GSL:
    gem install gsl 
You may notice a speed increase.

Jekyll's "related posts" uses latent semantic indexing, provided by Classifier::LSI. To do so, it uses vector analysis features, which can be accelerated by (a Ruby wrapper of) GSL, the GNU Scientific Library. If GSL isn't available, a pure-Ruby implementation is used, but it's exceptionally slow for big sites, and using GSL improves performance ~10x

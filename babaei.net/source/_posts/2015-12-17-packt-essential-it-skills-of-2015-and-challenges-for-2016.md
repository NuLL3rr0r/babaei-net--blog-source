At a time of rapid development and innovation, tech skills have never been more valuable. The right skills and cutting-edge knowledge can bring huge rewards.

Over the summer, Packt Publishing carried out [a survey of more than 20,000 people from across the world of tech](http://bit.ly/1NYBOs3), to investigate what skills are most important in today’s fast-changing technological landscape. Now, as the year draws to a close, the publisher is continuing their invitation to ‘Skill Up’ by reviewing the year and looking closely at what the future might hold. From the key challenges to the skills and tools people are most passionate about learning, Packt is preparing for an exciting 2016.

To do this, Packt has created a __short survey__ that asks respondents what was significant in 2015, and what trends and challenges look set to dominate technology in 2016. [Whatever your area of tech, Packt wants to hear from you](http://bit.ly/1HScEds)!

As a thank you, and to help you Skill Up in whichever way you choose, respondents will receive a __discount code allowing them to purchase any Packt eBook or video for just $5__. Because the publisher wants to hear from as many people as possible, they’re encouraging everyone who responds to share the survey with friends and colleagues – they’ll also receive a discount!

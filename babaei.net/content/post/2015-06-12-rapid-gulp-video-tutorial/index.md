Recently, [Packt Publishing](https://www.packtpub.com/) has released [a video course on Gulp by Matthew Brandly](http://bit.ly/1QNV4pF) which will teach you to use the tools needed to create better websites through clear examples and step-by-step instructions.

You’ll start with setting up Gulp and writing basic tasks, and move through common use cases to create a plugin from scratch. You will learn how to use Gulp through the many practical examples this course comes with, like optimizing your site’s files and automating the process of testing your code, as well as tips on how to get the most out of Gulp. You’ll gain a deeper understanding by looking at how streams work and how to define custom plugins.

By the end of this course, you’ll know how to create your own apps, make them look good, test them and more: everything you need to know about building apps with Gulp!

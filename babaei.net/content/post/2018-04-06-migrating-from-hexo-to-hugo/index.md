Hexo was so perfect and fast that I thought I will live with it happily ever after forever. Shortly, after I migrated this blog from [Octopress 2.x](http://octopress.org/) to [Hexo](https://hexo.io/), I came across [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static generator with support for blogging. The idea of having a blazingly fast static generator written in a compiled native language seemed intriguing to me. I tried to migrate my blog to Hugo soon after multiple times which led to failure every single time due to [lack of a few features in Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/1768).

Fast-forward, I played around with [Gutenburg](https://www.getgutenberg.io/) (written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)) a few month back. I found it to be an awesome project. Not only, every feature put together thoughtfully, but also [the developer](https://github.com/Keats) is very very responsive and welcomes new ideas and contributions warmly. Nonetheless, it's still young and immature. So, it failed me too.

I came back to check out Hugo once more last week and to my surprise, I found it really stable and production ready with tons of features and themes. So, here is my new blog ported over to the mighty Hugo.

__P.S.__ Although Hugo satisfies all my current needs, I'm more interested in Rust projects than the [Go](https://golang.org/) ones since I'm playing around with Rust as an alternative to Modern C++ these days. So, I'll keep an eye on Gutenberg; who knows another port might be underway :)

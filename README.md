===============

This is the source code for my blog based on [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) static generator.

**Note**: There are other branches called _octopress-v2_ and _hexo-v3_ which contain the old blog source codes based on [Octopress 2.x](https://github.com/imathis/octopress) and later [Hexo 3.x](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo) static generators. There is also an unfinished port to [Gutenberg](https://github.com/Keats/gutenberg) in a branch named _gutenberg_.

**Note**: I won't be maintaining my Farsi blog anymore. Checkout the _hugo-en-fa_ branch in order to access the last revision of the fa blog.

babaei.net and fa.babaei.net blogs
==================================

This is the source code for my blogs based on Hugo static generator.

**Note**: There are other branches called _octopress-v2_ and _hexo-v3_ which contain the old blog source codes based on [Octopress 2.x](https://github.com/imathis/octopress) and later [Hexo 3.x](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo) static generators. There is also an unfinished port to [Gutenberg](https://github.com/Keats/gutenberg) in a branch named _gutenberg_.

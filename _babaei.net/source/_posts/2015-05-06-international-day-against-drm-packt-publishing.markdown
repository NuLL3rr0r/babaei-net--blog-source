Digital Restrictions Management (DRM) harms almost everyone, but most people have never heard of it. Today is one of our best opportunities to change that.

There are people around the world coming together to say that we will not tolerate the remote deletions, unethical surveillance, and invasive restrictions of DRM. In fact, with events in at least nine countries and huge online participation, it's the world's biggest anti-DRM protest.

Well, I just found out that this year, to demonstrate their continuing support for Day Against DRM, as they celebrates [International Day Against DRM, May 6th 2015](https://www.defectivebydesign.org/dayagainstdrm), [Packt Publishing is offering all its DRM-free content at $10 for 24 hours only on May 6th](http://bit.ly/1clSCd7) – with more than 3000 eBooks and 100 Videos available across [the publisher’s website](http://www.packtpub.com/).

Our top priority at Packt has always been to meet the evolving needs of developers in the most practical way possible, while at the same time protecting the hard work of our authors. DRM-free content continues to be instrumental in making that happen, providing the flexibility and freedom that is essential for an efficient and enhanced learning experience. That’s why we’ve been DRM-free from the beginning – we’ll never put limits on the innovation of our users.

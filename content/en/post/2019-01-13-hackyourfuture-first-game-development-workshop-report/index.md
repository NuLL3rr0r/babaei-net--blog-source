OK! Today, [HackYourFuture](https://www.hackyourfuture.net/) held their first-ever gamedev workshop titled "Introduction to Unreal Engine 4 Game Development Using Blueprint" at their Amsterdam office, which I've been given the opportunity to present to their alumni on HackYourFuture's behalf.

Since I'm still very excited and fascinated by the culture of sharing and the friendly environment governed by HackYourFuture, I decided to share the presentation file which I did prepare for this four hour workshop under the terms of [(CC BY-SA 3.0) Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/), to be used by anyone who is either new to game development or is intersted in the topic. It's jam packed with so much information for absolute beginners. Feel free to share and adapt according to your own needs under the terms of the license.

The presentation can be found at the end of this post in PDF, OpenDocument Presentation, or Microsoft PowerPoint formats.

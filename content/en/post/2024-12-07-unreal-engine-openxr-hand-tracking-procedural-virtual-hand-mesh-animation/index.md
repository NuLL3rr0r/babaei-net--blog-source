## Unreal Engine Tutorial: Procedural Virtual Hand Mesh Animation Using OpenXR Hand-Tracking Data

Building on the [Introduction to Virtual Reality, OpenXR Hand-Tracking, and Gesture Recognition in Unreal Engine](https://www.babaei.net/blog/virtual-reality-openxr-hand-tracking-gesture-recognition-detection-unreal-engine/) tutorial, this slightly more advanced tutorial will dive deeper into the following topics:

- Transitioning seamlessly between motion controller and hand-tracking modes in Unreal Engine.
- Adding custom debugging gizmos to improve development and testing workflows.
- Visualizing debug virtual hands by incorporating the custom gizmos.
- Animating virtual hand meshes with OpenXR hand-tracking data, moving beyond basic joint representation with cubes.
- Re-using and adapting the gesture recognition code from the introductory tutorial to integrate with the new animated virtual hand meshes.

This guide will help you take your VR projects to the next level with polished and practical implementations.

Here's a lesser-known fact about me. Once upon a time, when it was just me and the dinosaurs... Okay, maybe not that far back, but long before VR headsets, the Metaverse, and the social media craze, I used to teach people things for 8 years! I loved it so much that, honestly, I could talk for hours (don't worry, I won't in this video)!

Anyway, enough of my rambling! Recently, I rediscovered that passion for teaching, and I'm thrilled to kick off a VR tutorial series in Unreal Engine. That's why, as the introductory step into this series, we're diving hands-first into the fascinating world of virtual reality.

But, before we jump in, make sure to hit that subscribe button so you don't miss any of my VR adventures.

Ready? Let's bring those virtual hands to life!
